#####   Mortar-Fire-Fix-Calculation   #####

# This aplication is tipically about military issues, especially Fireworks Support
# It automatically calculates Mortar Fire Corrections from basic informations like 'distance of target', 'fire variation'...
# The project uses a 'mathematical formula': M = 1000 * F / D
# M -> Millesimal /// F -> Front Variation /// D -> Distance
# This Project was developed to works for ROYAL ORDNANCE MORTAR 81mm with any ammunition type
# Simplification based on the mechanisms limit of capacity
